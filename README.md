# Mental-Health-ChatBot
This is a project that I create for people who were stuck in different cities during the lockdown period to have someone to talk to. This chatbot is perfectly capable of keeping conversations in a flow and change the storyline according to the user's intent.

# How to Run the Code
The code base is sperated into multiple modules. To run and test the project just install the requirements.txt file and run the "final code.py" file.
